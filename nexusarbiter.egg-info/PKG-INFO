### AI HACK

 In this repository, there is a file called `merged_all`. It includes all necessary files in this project, along with this README.
 If you provide this file to your own AI and ask it to analyze the contents, the AI can guide you through the entire framework. It takes very little time for it to fully comprehend NexusArbiter.

### NexusArbiter — Compiled Creativity

NexusArbiter is a file-based, deterministic multi-agent framework. By design, it is:

* **Reproducible**
* **Auditable**
* **Predictable**
* **Configurable**

It proposes a structured and explicit way to interact with AI agents, making it an ideal candidate for real-world and enterprise use cases.

## Requirements

* **Python 3.10** or newer
* A valid **API key** for a supported provider (OpenAI or Gemini)
* Windows, macOS, or Linux

## What Is a Prompt Model?

A Prompt Model is the complete set of context files required for an AI system to achieve a human-defined goal. It is not a single prompt. It is a structured execution model composed of explicit artifacts.

A Prompt Model consists of five file types:

1.  **Runs**
    Define the sequential execution of agents required to reach the target goal.
2.  **Context Files**
    Include rules, response schemas, and examples provided to the AI.
3.  **Profiles**
    Define agent personas, provider-specific parameters, and generic agent instructions.
4.  **Target Files**
    Represent validated outputs produced by agents.
5.  **Reruns**
    Define alternative or repeated agent calls that can be executed with the same or different context files when a previous step (typically a validator) requests a retry.

These abstractions are sufficient to model and execute most automation workflows required to achieve complex tasks.

## How to Use

NexusArbiter follows a **Bring Your Own Key** philosophy and currently supports OpenAI and Gemini. Additional providers will be added.

### Configure your API key

You can set your API key using a `.env` file.
Or by setting an environment variable directly on Windows.

### Prepare a run configuration

Locate a `run.json` file (an example is provided in the repository). Place a simple application idea inside it. The more context you provide, the better the result will be. With the current Prompt Model, NexusArbiter is optimized for small applications.

### Run the workflow

Run the workflow using:

python main.py myproject/run.json

Note: This entry point will be replaced with a packaged CLI in a future release.

While the workflow is running, you can inspect the run.json file and related context files, or ask your AI to explain them.

Output

When execution completes, multiple files will be generated as output.

Enjoy your generated application.
