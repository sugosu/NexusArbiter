The app will support managing books, members, and book loans. It must enforce business rules to prevent borrowing if a book is out of stock or if a member has exceeded their loan limit, and runs fully offline. The entry point (main.py) wires up dependencies and executes core operations directly. No CLI command parsing, no stdin input.",
