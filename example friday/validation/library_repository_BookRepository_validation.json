  "class_name": "library.repository.BookRepository",
  "overall_quality": "good",
  "summary": "The implementation in library_manager/library/repository.py correctly implements the BookRepository class per the manifest: constructor, private fields, and all required methods (load_all, save, update, delete) are present with matching signatures and expected behavior. Only a minor import-list mismatch was detected.",
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "IMPORT_MISMATCH",
      "severity": "minor",
      "message": "The module 'typing' import in the implementation includes 'Optional', but the manifest declaration for library.repository.BookRepository lists only ['List', 'Dict', 'Any']. This is an import-list divergence between code and manifest.",
      "location": "library_manager/library/repository.py:1 (imports)",
      "related_spec": "library.repository.BookRepository.imports in example/manifest/manifest.json"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "If you require strict exact-match between generated code and manifest, remove 'Optional' from the typing import in library_manager/library/repository.py so imports exactly match the manifest (List, Dict, Any).",
    "Alternatively, if Optional is intentionally used (e.g., for the update return annotation), update the manifest's imports for library.repository.BookRepository to include 'Optional' and regenerate or record the change so manifest and code remain in sync.",
    "No functional changes to repository behavior are required; the implementation is safe and follows repository responsibilities (uses JsonStorage.read/write, emits debug messages through ConsolePrinter, and performs no domain logic)."
