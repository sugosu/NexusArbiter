  "overall_quality": "excellent",
  "summary": "The implementation in library_manager/core/storage.py matches the manifest for core.storage.JsonStorage: class name, constructor signature, field, methods (read/write), and imports are present and correctly implemented. Behavior for JSON I/O and ConsolePrinter usage aligns with the specified steps.",
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "UNUSED_IMPORTS",
      "severity": "minor",
      "message": "typing imports 'Dict' and 'List' are imported but not used in this module.",

    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Remove unused typing imports (Dict, List) to satisfy style/lint rules and reduce noise.",
    "Optionally add unit tests that exercise read() on valid JSON, missing files, and malformed JSON to verify ConsolePrinter calls and return values (None on error).",
    "Consider narrowing the broad except Exception handlers around ConsolePrinter calls if strict exception policies are desired (currently they defensively swallow printer errors which is acceptable but could hide issues)."
