  "class_name": "main.Main",
  "overall_quality": "excellent",
  "summary": "The implementation in library_manager/main.py matches the manifest declaration for main.Main: required imports, constructor signature and assignments, private fields, and the run() orchestration behavior are present and correct. No comments or docstrings are present, complying with generation rules.",
  "issues": [],
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider sourcing persistent paths (books_path, members_path, loans_path) from configuration or environment variables instead of hard-coded literals to increase flexibility and align with typical deployment practices.",
    "Keep Main free of domain logic (as implemented). If future initialization steps are required, prefer configuration-driven wiring and keep orchestration minimal."
