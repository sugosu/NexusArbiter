    "Add unit tests that assert LibraryApp.run calls LibraryService.list_* with the provided paths and that ConsolePrinter.print_summary is called with the expected summary structure.",
    "Consider normalizing handling of unexpected None returns from service methods (service contract currently indicates lists should be returned; if repositories/storage may return None, unit tests should codify desired behavior)."
