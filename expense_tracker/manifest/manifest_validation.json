  "class_name": "AppController",
  "overall_quality": "good",
  "summary": "AppController implementation follows the manifest/story requirements and wiring strategy, constructs components in the expected order, supports constructor injection for test doubles, initializes the repository, and manages lifecycle state transitions. No functional correctness issues were detected in the code shown.",
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "FILE_LOCATION_MISMATCH",
      "severity": "minor",
      "message": "The implementation file is located at 'expense_tracker/src/controller.py' but the manifest lists the AppController component in 'main.py'. This is a packaging/placement mismatch between manifest and source layout.",
      "location": "expense_tracker/src/controller.py",
      "related_spec": "manifest.files -> component 'AppController' expected in 'main.py'"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Rename or move the source file to match the manifest entry (main.py) or update the manifest to point to controller.py so tooling and packaging remain consistent.",
    "Ensure project entrypoints and packaging (e.g., setup.cfg/pyproject) reference the actual module path used at build/runtime (AppController location).",
    "Optionally add a brief unit/integration test for AppController.start() verifying that repository.initialize_store() is called and the state transitions to READY on success and to ERROR on unrecoverable IO exceptions."
