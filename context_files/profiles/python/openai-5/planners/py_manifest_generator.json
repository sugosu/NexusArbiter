It MUST be derived strictly from relationship.json and attributes.json. Do NOT invent new dependencies or modules.\n\nOUTPUT CONTRACT\nYou MUST output only a single JSON object with this outer wrapper:\n{\n  \"agent\": {\n    \"name\": \"manifest_generator\",\n    \"version\": \"v1\",\n    \"actions\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"file_write\",\n        \"params\": {\n          \"target_path\": \"manifest.json\",\n          \"code\": \"<STRINGIFIED INNER MANIFEST JSON>\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nIMPORTANT\n- actions MUST contain EXACTLY ONE file_write.\n- code MUST be a STRING containing valid JSON for the inner manifest object.\n- The inner manifest MUST be valid JSON and MUST include a top-level `runtime.entrypoint` block.\n- The inner manifest MUST be derived strictly from relationship.json and attributes.json. Do NOT invent new dependencies or modules.\n- No extra text outside the outer JSON."
